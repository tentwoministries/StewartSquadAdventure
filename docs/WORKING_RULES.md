## Working Rules (apply to every session, every agent, every file)

These are Andrew's standing rules. They go at the top of every handoff document, every subagent system prompt, and `CLAUDE.md`. Subagents do not inherit the parent session's context, so each agent file must carry these verbatim.

1. **Missing inputs → stop and ask.** If a file, data source, or piece of context needed to do a task *properly* is missing, stop and ask Andrew rather than shipping incomplete work wrapped in disclaimers. Never paper over gaps. (Creative decisions are *not* missing inputs — see docs/BRIEF.md §2. Decide, log, proceed.)
2. **Pre-build gate for every external interface.** Before writing integration code against any API, package, or data format (Rapier, postprocessing, Colyseus, GLB loaders, save schema, Puppeteer GL flags), hit it with a real call and verify the actual response/shape. Never code against assumed or documented field names. Record the verified shape in the task's notes before proceeding. Non-negotiable.
3. **No assumptions in code.** Verify every field name, handler name, parameter, and format against the real source before writing tests, configs, or integration code. If unsure, grep the codebase first.
4. **Single Pro Inspection Checklist V2 — all 27 steps, every delivery, no tiers.** (Full list: docs/INSPECTION_CHECKLIST.md)
   - P0 pre-build: memory/handoff read, design approval on record, API verification done, inherited code audited
   - P1 static: `tsc --noEmit` clean, runtime import check, AST/import trace, duplicate definitions, TODO sweep
   - P2 semantic: call-chain trace, entry points, name collisions, fuzzy/near-duplicate logic, substring hazards, possessive/string hazards in content, router/state-machine transitions
   - P3 infra: priority ordering, data field coverage, async correctness, rate/frame budgets, deferred work listed, exclusions documented
   - P4 delivery: filenames, packaging, regression suite green, version stamp, line/size count
5. **Handoff is the source of truth.** Every session ends by writing `docs/NEXT_SESSION.md` with these Working Rules at the top, current state, what's done, what's next, and known issues. The next session starts by reading it.
6. **Deliverables are files, not chat.** Everything lands in the repo. Andrew never copy-pastes from chat.
7. **Tests: trim before adding.** Before generating new tests, do a trim pass on the existing suite; target ~100 tests per suite; propose specific trims with rationale before writing new ones.

**Family canon is sacred.** The kids' names, colors, roles, and personality framing never change: **Liam** (blue, tank/leader), **Noah** (orange, ranger/archer), **Collette** (purple, mage/enchanter), **Isabella** (pink/red, berserker/guardian). Grandpa Ed flies the biplane. Existing dialogue, quest text, in-jokes, cutscene lines, voice lines, achievement names, and loading tips are ported **verbatim** — never paraphrased or "improved". New text may be added. Nothing ships that isn't family-friendly.
